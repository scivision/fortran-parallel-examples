Examples of parallel runtimes from native Fortran syntax.
[Fortrran coarrays or direct MPI operations](https://github.com/scivision/fortran-coarray-mpi-examples)
are in a separate repo.

Examples include:

* do concurrent: including Fortran 202x "reduce" syntax supported by NVidia HPC SDK and Intel oneAPI
* OpenACC: directive for Fortran
* openmp: OpenMP threading exmaples
